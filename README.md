# Smart-Waste-Segregation-System
InVedX is an AI-driven Smart Waste Segregation and Recycling System developed during a code hackathon. The project focuses on improving waste management by using intelligent automation and sensor-based technology to identify, classify, and segregate waste efficiently.

Problem Statement

Improper waste disposal and lack of segregation at the source lead to:

- Low recycling efficiency
- Increased landfill waste
- Environmental pollution
- High manual effort in sorting waste
- Poor implementation of sustainable waste management practices


💡 Proposed Solution

The Smart Waste Segregation System uses sensors and AI-based classification to:

- Automatically detect the type of waste (e.g., biodegradable, recyclable, non-recyclable)
- Segregate waste at the point of disposal
- Reduce human intervention
- Improve recycling accuracy
- Enable smart monitoring of waste collection


🛠️ Tech Stack

- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Data Processing Systems
- Smart Sensors & Automation
- Embedded/IoT-based Detection Mechanism (conceptual implementation)


⚙️ Methodology

1. Waste is inserted into the smart disposal unit.
2. Sensors analyze material properties.
3. AI/Data logic classifies the waste category.
4. Automated mechanism directs waste into the correct bin.
5. Segregated waste is sent for proper recycling or disposal.
